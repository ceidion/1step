h2. Description

h3. Overview

1step is an universal software project starter which helps you setup basic development environment.

h3. Why

It is very boring to setup development environment. Take a Ruby project as example. Before I write a single line of Ruby code, I need to
* Install RVM
* Install Ruby
* Install bundler
* Write a Gemfile
* Create lib directory for source code
* Create spec directory for test code
* Create Rakefile as build script

We have to face nearly the same situation for every other project as well. 

What 1step try to do is to make our life easier.
